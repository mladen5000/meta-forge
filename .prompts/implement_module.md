Task: Implement a new Rust module per the spec, integrate with crate, add tests first.

Rules:
- Idiomatic Rust (ownership, lifetimes, error handling).
- Update lib/bin wiring and feature flags as needed.
- Benchmarks optional; tests required.

Acceptance:
- `cargo test` (or nextest) is green.
- Public API documented (///).
