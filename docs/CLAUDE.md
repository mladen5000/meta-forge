# MetaForge Development Progress - Claude Session Notes

## Current Status (2025-08-08) - ASSEMBLY WORKING ✅

### ✅ Completed Features - ASSEMBLY FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Core Pipeline Architecture**: Fully implemented metagenomic analysis pipeline
- **K-mer Analysis**: Advanced k-mer counting and analysis with adaptive sizing  
- **Assembly System**: ✅ WORKING - De Bruijn graph-based assembly with repeat resolution
- **Assembly Pipeline**: All core functionality operational including error correction and quality assessment
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Neural networks for sequence classification and repeat resolution
- **Database Integration**: SQLite-based storage for analysis results and metadata
- **Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive feature extraction including:
  - GC content analysis
  - Codon usage bias
  - Amino acid composition
  - Structural motifs
- **Quality Control**: Read correction and quality assessment
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing with configurable thread pools
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible YAML-based configuration system
- **Progress Tracking**: Multi-level progress reporting system

### 🔄 In Progress / Partially Working
- **TUI Interface**: Terminal user interface implemented but has navigation issues
  - Main menu displays correctly
  - Screen transitions work but key handling is problematic
  - Navigation appears to freeze after selecting menu items
  - All screen components are implemented (Database, File Selection, Configuration, etc.)

### ❌ Known Issues

#### 1. TUI Navigation Problem
**Status**: CRITICAL - Interface unresponsive
**Description**: After selecting any menu item from the main menu, the TUI becomes unresponsive to key inputs except Esc. The screens render correctly but don't respond to navigation keys.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/tui/app.rs` - Main application event loop
- `src/tui/screens/mod.rs` - Screen manager key routing
- All screen implementations in `src/tui/screens/`

**Attempted Fixes**:
- Fixed async lock handling in event processing
- Simplified global key binding logic
- Enhanced screen manager key routing
- Added proper state transitions

**Current Hypothesis**: Event loop or async state management issue preventing key events from reaching screen handlers.

#### 2. K-mer Processing Error
**Status**: HIGH - Affects core functionality
**Error Message**: `K-mer contains ambiguous bases (N): AATACAAGCATCAAATNNNNNNGCTGTCTG`

**Description**: The k-mer analysis pipeline fails when encountering sequences with ambiguous bases (N nucleotides). This is common in real sequencing data and needs proper handling.

**Impact**: Prevents processing of realistic FASTQ files with quality issues or sequencing gaps.

**Required Fix**: Implement ambiguous base handling in k-mer extraction:
- Skip k-mers containing N bases
- Or replace N bases with most likely nucleotides
- Add configuration option for handling strategy

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture:

```
src/
├── core/                 # Core data structures and algorithms
├── assembly/            # Genome assembly components
├── features/            # Feature extraction modules  
├── ml/                  # Machine learning components
├── pipeline/            # Main pipeline orchestration
├── tui/                 # Terminal user interface
├── database/            # Database integration
└── utils/               # Utility functions
```

### 🧪 Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Partially implemented
- **Integration Tests**: Limited coverage
- **TUI Testing**: Manual testing only
- **Performance Tests**: Basic benchmarking implemented

### 📋 Priority TODO List

1. **URGENT**: Fix TUI key handling and navigation responsiveness
2. **HIGH**: Implement proper ambiguous base handling in k-mer processing
3. **MEDIUM**: Add comprehensive error handling for malformed FASTQ files
4. **MEDIUM**: Expand test coverage, especially for edge cases
5. **LOW**: Performance optimization for large datasets

### 🔧 Development Environment
- **Language**: Rust 2021 edition
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `ratatui` for TUI interface
  - `tokio` for async runtime
  - `bio` for bioinformatics algorithms
  - `rusqlite` for database operations
  - `ndarray` for numerical computations
  - `serde` for serialization

### 📊 Code Quality
- **Build Status**: ✅ Compiles with warnings
- **Warnings**: 64 compiler warnings (mostly unused code)
- **Code Style**: Follows Rust conventions
- **Documentation**: Inline docs present, external docs needed

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Debug TUI event handling system
2. Add N-base filtering to k-mer extraction
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Write user documentation
