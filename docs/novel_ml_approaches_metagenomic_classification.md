## 6. Integration Points with Existing Pipeline

### Current Pipeline Structure
```
Input FASTQ → Preprocessing → Assembly → Feature Extraction → Classification → Output
```

### Enhanced ML Pipeline
```
Input FASTQ
    ↓
Preprocessing (existing)
    ↓
Assembly (existing laptop_assembly.rs)
    ↓
Feature Extraction (enhanced with GenomeOcean embeddings)
    ↓
ML Classification (NEW: GraphMB + optional COMEBin)
    ↓
Taxonomic Assignment (existing)
    ↓
Output (existing AsyncOutputManager)
```

### Specific Integration Points

**1. Feature Extraction Stage** (`src/utils/configuration.rs`):
```rust
pub struct FeatureExtractionConfig {
    // Existing fields...

    // NEW ML fields
    pub use_genomeocean_embeddings: bool,
    pub embedding_model_size: String,  // "100M", "500M", "4B"
    pub embedding_batch_size: usize,
    pub cache_embeddings: bool,
}
```

**2. Classification Stage** (`fast_pipeline.rs` line 285-316):
Replace simplified classification with ML-based approach:
```rust
async fn run_classification(
    &self,
    assembly_results: &AssemblyResults,
    features: &FeatureCollection,
    _progress_info: &str,
) -> Result<Vec<TaxonomicClassification>> {

    if self.config.ml_config.enabled {
        // Use ML classification
        self.run_ml_classification(assembly_results, features).await
    } else {
        // Fallback to existing simplified approach
        self.run_traditional_classification(assembly_results, features).await
    }
}
```

**3. Output Enhancement** (already supports JSON via AsyncOutputManager):
- Add ML-specific metrics (embedding quality, GNN confidence scores)
- Include bin quality metrics (completeness, contamination)
- Log model versions and parameters

## 7. Performance Expectations

### Benchmark Comparisons (Expected)

**Current meta-forge (simplified classification):**
- Classification accuracy: ~60-70% (placeholder algorithm)
- Processing time: Fast (no ML overhead)
- Memory usage: Low (<2GB)

**With GenomeOcean + GraphMB:**
- Classification accuracy: **85-95%** (based on literature)
- HQ bins: **+17.5%** more than baseline
- Processing time: +30-50% (embedding extraction overhead)
- Memory usage: 8-16GB (model + embeddings)

**With Full Pipeline (+ COMEBin refinement):**
- Classification accuracy: **90-98%**
- Novel BGCs: **+29.78%** vs. competitors
- Processing time: +50-80% vs. baseline
- Memory usage: 12-24GB

### Scalability Analysis

| Dataset Size | Method | Time (est.) | Memory | GPU Required |

## 8. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Python-Rust Interop Overhead**
- **Impact:** Performance degradation from IPC
- **Mitigation:** Use PyO3 with zero-copy numpy arrays; batch processing
- **Fallback:** Rust-native ONNX runtime for inference

**Risk 2: Model Size & Memory**
- **Impact:** 4B parameter GenomeOcean requires significant RAM/VRAM
- **Mitigation:** Use smaller models (100M, 500M); quantization; CPU offload
- **Fallback:** Use lightweight DNASimCLR or SemiBin2

**Risk 3: GPU Availability**
- **Impact:** Slow inference on CPU-only systems
- **Mitigation:** Provide CPU-optimized paths; batch processing; model distillation
- **Fallback:** Disable ML features, use traditional classification

### Dependency Risks

**Risk 1: PyTorch/HuggingFace Version Conflicts**
- **Impact:** Model compatibility issues
- **Mitigation:** Pin exact versions; Docker containerization
- **Fallback:** Virtual environment isolation

**Risk 2: External Model Availability**
- **Impact:** GenomeOcean models unavailable/deprecated
- **Mitigation:** Cache models locally; use alternative (Nucleotide Transformer)
- **Fallback:** Train custom lightweight model

---

## 9. Alternative Minimal Implementation

If full implementation is too complex, start with this minimal viable approach:

### Minimal ML Enhancement (2-3 weeks)

**Approach: SemiBin2 Integration Only**

```rust
// Minimal addition to fast_pipeline.rs
pub struct MinimalMLConfig {
    pub use_semibin: bool,
    pub semibin_path: PathBuf,
}

async fn run_semibin_classification(
    &self,
    contigs: &[Contig],
) -> Result<Vec<Bin>> {
    // 1. Write contigs to temp FASTA
    // 2. Call SemiBin2 via subprocess
    // 3. Parse output bins
    // 4. Return classifications
}
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal code changes (<500 lines)
- No Python interop required
- Proven production tool
- Fast execution

**Cons:**
- Less accuracy than GraphMB/GenomeOcean
- No graph awareness
- Limited customization
