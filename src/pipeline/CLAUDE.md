# Pipeline Module Guidelines

## Purpose
High-level orchestration of the complete metagenomic analysis workflow.

## Key Components
- `integrated.rs` - Main pipeline coordination
- `complete_integration.rs` - End-to-end workflow management

## Development Rules
- Handle partial failures gracefully with checkpoints
- Log pipeline progress for user feedback
- Make pipeline steps configurable and optional
- Use clear error messages for pipeline failures

## Pipeline Architecture
- Modular design allows skipping/replacing steps
- Clear data flow between pipeline stages
- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Parallel execution where dependencies allow

## Error Recovery
- Implement checkpoint/resume functionality
- Provide clear progress indicators
- Handle resource exhaustion gracefully
- Allow partial results when possible

## Configuration Management
- Use structured configuration with validation
- Support both file-based and programmatic config
- Document all configuration options
- Provide sensible defaults for common use cases

## Performance Monitoring
- Track memory usage throughout pipeline
- Monitor CPU utilization and bottlenecks
- Log timing information for each stage
- Provide performance tuning recommendations

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests with real metagenomic datasets
- Test failure recovery and partial completion
- Validate output formats and quality
- Benchmark against reference pipelines
